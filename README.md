# Hand-Gesture-Calculator
A Python-based calculator that uses real-time hand gesture recognition for arithmetic operations. Built using MediaPipe and OpenCV, it detects finger positions to input numbers and perform basic math functions like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division â€” all without touching the keyboard.
